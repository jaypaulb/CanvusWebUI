{check out the curent image of the undelete page and you will see a very different aproach to what is implemented.
please update the undelete section in macros to follow this approach.
button that populates the list of delete history 
see server.js for the api endpoint for this.
then slecting a zone and clicking an item from the list shows a dialog with details of hat will be restored and seeks confirmation.
confirning actions the creation of the items in that delete history json again check the server.js for the relevent endpoint.}

Diagnose and resolve the current issue with the mindset of a senior architect/engineer:

1. **Understand Architecture First**:
   - Identify the application's architecture patterns and key abstractions
   - Map the component hierarchy and data flow relevant to the issue
   - Determine if the issue stems from architectural misalignment
   - Consider how the solution should fit into the existing architecture

2. **Assess the Issue Holistically**:
   - Gather all error messages, logs, and behavioral symptoms
   - Consider at least 3 potential root causes at different system layers
   - Evaluate if the issue reveals a design flaw rather than just a bug

3. **Discover Reusable Solutions**:
   - Search for similar patterns already solved elsewhere in the codebase
   - Identify existing utilities, helpers, or abstractions that could address the problem
   - Check if common patterns (error handling, data validation, etc.) are consistently applied
   - Look for opportunities to extract reusable solutions from the fix

4. **Analyze with Engineering Rigor**:
   - Trace dependencies and interactions between components
   - Review separation of concerns and adherence to project conventions
   - Assess performance implications of the issue and potential solutions
   - Consider maintainability and testing aspects

5. **Propose Strategic Solutions**:
   - Present solutions that align with the existing architecture
   - Specify exact file paths and line numbers for changes
   - Include refactoring opportunities that improve code organization
   - Explain the engineering principles behind each solution
   - Balance immediate fixes with long-term architectural improvements

6. **Validate Like a Professional**:
   - Define comprehensive test scenarios covering edge cases
   - Specify appropriate validation methods for the project's stack
   - Suggest monitoring approaches to verify the solution's effectiveness
   - Consider potential regressions and how to prevent them

This approach ensures solutions that not only fix the immediate issue but strengthen the codebase's architecture and maintainability.
